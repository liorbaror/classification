    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to train an image classification model that can automatically recognize the breed of a dog based on an input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "The model classifies images into the following dog breeds:\n",
    "- Border Collie\n",
    "- Boxer\n",
    "- Cocker Spaniel\n",
    "- German Shepherd\n",
    "- Labrador\n",
    "- Malinois\n",
    "- Poodle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "Such a model can be useful for:\n",
    "- Pet-related mobile apps\n",
    "- Assisting shelters or veterinary systems in identifying dog breeds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images may vary in angle, and background\n",
    "- Some dog breeds have similar visual features\n",
    "- The age of the dog may affect the dog’s external appearance\n",
    "- The size of the dog and body proportions may vary even within the same breed\n"
